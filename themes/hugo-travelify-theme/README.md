## Get the theme

If you have `git` installed, you can do the following at the command-line-interface within the Hugo directory:

```
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/balaramadurai/hugo-travelify-theme.git
```

You should see a folder called `hugo-travelify-theme` inside the `themes` directory that we created a few moments ago. For more information read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

## Setup

In the next step navigate to the `exampleSite` folder at `themes/hugo-travelify-theme/exampleSite/`. Its structure should look similar to this:

```
exampleSite
|   config.toml
+---content
|   |   about.md
|   |   contact.md
|   \---post
|           creating-a-new-theme.md
|           go-is-for-lovers.md
|           hugo-is-for-lovers.md
|           linked-post.md
|           migrate-from-jekyll.md
|           this-post-has-no-body.md
+---data
|       l10n.toml
\---static
    |   new-york-featured.jpg
    \---banners
            7148951717_9bbf185db3_h-1018x460.jpg
            featured-4.jpg
            featured-5.jpg
            new-york-featured.jpg
            placeholder.png
            Spain-Plaza-de-Cibeles-Madrid-1018x460.jpg
            Spain-Plaza-de-Cibeles-Madrid-670x300.jpg
            spain6-1018x460.jpg
```

To get your site running, copy `config.toml` and `data/l10n.toml` into the root folder. (Please refer to http://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/ for installing a Hugo theme.)

## The `config` file

Now, let us take a look at `config.toml`. Let's take a look at some of the settings.

### 1. Automatic slider

Using the parameters in the config, the slider can be switched on and off at will and the number of banner images on the carousel can be customized.

```
[params.slider]
enable = true
num_features = 4 # The slider picks up the banner images from the N most recent posts, where num_features is N.
```

*Tip* - For best results in the slider, use **1018x460** resolution for the banner images.

### 2. Google Analytics

```
GoogleAnalytics = ""
```

### 3. Comments

The comment system is an optional feature powered by Disqus. Enter your *shortname* to enable the comments section under your posts.

```
disqusShortname = ""
```

*Tip* - You can disable the comments section for a single page in its `frontmatter`:

```toml
+++
disable_comments = true
+++
```

### 4. Menu

The entries in the items menu can be customized. First, let us link a post that you've written. We can do this in the `frontmatter` of the post's content file by setting `menu` to `main`.

```
+++
menu = "main"
+++
```

Further, we can add entries that don't link to posts. Back in the `config.toml` you'll find a section for the menus:

```
[[menu.main]]
    name  = "Contact"
    url   = "/contact/"
    weight = 20
```

Define a label and enter the URL of the resource you want to link. With `before` you can decide whether the link should appear before **or** after all linked posts in the menu. Therefore, `Home` appears before the linked post.

### 5. Sidebars

To use the full width of the website you can disable the profile on the left and / or the widgets on the right for a single page in the `frontmatter`:

```toml
+++
disable_profile = true
disable_widgets = true
+++
```

### 6. Tell me who you are

This theme also provides a profile section. Add your social network accounts to the profile section by entering your user name under `social`. The links to your accounts will be created automatically.

### 7. Widgets

You can add widgets to the right sidebar. The following widgets are available:

- recent articles
- category list
- tag list
- tag cloud
- Duckduckgo search enabled on your website

You can deactivate them under `params.widgets`:

```
# Enable and disable widgets for the right sidebar
[params.widgets]
    recent_articles = true
    categories = true
    tags = true
    tag_cloud = true
    archives = false # This feature is yet to be implemented because of limitations in Hugo's way of working.
    search = true
```

### 8. Date line

The date line includes: post date, categories, comments and sharing links. However, if you want certain pages to omit the date line, simply put `nodateline = true` in the front matter for that page.

### 9. Disable previous/next article links and remove tags

To disable the inclusion of a previous/next article link at the bottom of the page, add `noprevnext = true` to `frontmatter`.  This feature, along with `nodateline = true`, can be used to create standalone pages that are less "blog-like".

### 10. Translation (l10n)

You don't blog in English and you want to translate the theme into your own language? No problem. Inside the `exampleSite/data` folder you'll find a file `l10n.toml`. It contains all the strings related to the theme. Just replace the original strings with your own.

### 11. Linking thumbnails

After creating a new post you can define a banner by entering the relative path to the image.

```
banner = "banners/placeholder.png"
```

This way you can store the images either in the same folder as your post or in the `static` folder.

*Tip* - For best results in the slider, use **1018x460** resolution for the banner images.

## Nearly finished

To preview your site, run Hugo's built-in local server.

```
$ hugo server
```

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313) in the address bar of your browser.
