Bilberry is a premium theme for the [Hugo Static Website Builder](https://gohugo.io).
It is full of little nice features, such as:

- built-in integration for the wounderful [algolia search](https://algolia.com)
- built-in integration for the powerful [disqus comments](https://disqus.com)
- gravatar and custom image integration for the header
- keyboard shortcut for the search (press the `s` key, type something and hit `esc`)
- responsive design - optimized for desctop and mobile devices
- full internationalization (i18n) support (en, de, fr, ru, es out of the box!)
- custom post types (article, audio, code, gallery, link, page, picture, quote, video)
    - easy configuration to add more according to your needs


*This Bilberry theme is inspired by the Lingonberry theme from [Anders Nor√©n](http://www.andersnoren.se/teman/lingonberry-wordpress-theme/)*
