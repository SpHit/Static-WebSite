### HTML5 Boilerplate [and Normalize.css]

Ok so I didn't do all of this theme myself.  I did have to embarrassingly rely on [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) and [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).  For a beginner like me these are absolutely amazingly brilliant bits of work.  Although I was utterly dismayed to find that a shim like normalize.css was necessary.  Seriously, wtf?  Isn't there like a W3C, or perhaps ISO to tell people how to make a consistent renderer.  I know that as a neophyte I probably sound completely ignorant here, and also that there's a ton of history behind this.  But goddamn.  Wouldn't have had this problem in Soviet Russia... nor perhaps the money for a computer but whatever.  These things meant I had to think less, so thank you!

### Hugo

Is [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) itself a dependency?  I don't know what I'm supposed to put in this readme but duh, you need hugo to use this theme.  And again thank you for being like the normalize dudes and making a thing that didn't require me to think.  I roll Windows like a total web n00b and I'm usually using all my brainpower to not bump into things, so the fact I could just freaking download an .exe and not even have to add it to my path made me smile.  I mean I did stare for way too long trying to decide if I could use the 64-bit version or not (seriously, who calls it AMD64 anymore?! Just call it x64 like the rest of the world and stop trying to be cool, hugo dudes).  But yeah you are kind of cool, especially since I went to Jekyll first and they told me I needed some ruby gems...  Only my wife gets "ruby gems" (normal people just call them "rubies") from me... otherwise who has time for that shit.

### Google Fonts

The default configuration uses a rather nice geometric sans-serif font called [Montserrat](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat) hosted by Google Fonts.
