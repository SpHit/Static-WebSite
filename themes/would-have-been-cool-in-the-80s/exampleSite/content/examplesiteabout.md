A minimalist, sort of retro theme.  Objectives are:

* Simple to adapt/maintain
* Fast loading with minimal dependencies (no scripting)
* Not entirely ugly - probably the weak link, let's be honest

The theme was inspired by the following geometric shapes to whom all credit is owed:

* All right-angled quadrilaterals
* The fillet (but not the chamfer, aka "the devil's corner")

A live site using this theme: [socratic.space](http://socratic.space) (warning: it's terrible)
