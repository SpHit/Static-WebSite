Hugo Theme Wave is a single column theme for hugo based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and a css styling from [Bootstrap Enhancement](http://behigh.github.io/bootstrap_dropdowns_enhancement/).

It is a simple template containing a nice header menu bar and content area.

## Get the source code

I assume you've Git installed. Inside the folder of your Hugo site run

```bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/syui/hugo-theme-wave.git
$ cd hugo-theme-wave
```

## Start Command

```bash
$ hugo server
------------------------
$ curl -sL localhost:1313/hugo-theme-wave
```

## Nearly finished

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

```bash
$ sudo pacman -S go
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/go
$ go get -v github.com/spf13/hugo

$ hugo

$ hugo server
------------------------
$ curl -sL localhost:1313/hugo-theme-wave
```

Now enter `localhost:1313/hugo-theme-wave` in the address bar of your browser.
