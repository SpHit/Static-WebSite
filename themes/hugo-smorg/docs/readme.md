# hugo-smorg

Hugo-smorg is a mobile-first / responsive Bulma-powered theme for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator. 

The theme is under on-going development and is being used as a base theme for
a number of other projects. This theme will keep pace with Hugo features as
Hugo evolves.
