[Hugo-smorg][] (smorg = small org, or smorgasbord perhaps) is a responsive
mobile-first, [Bulma][]-powered, reasonably minimalistic theme for the [Hugo][]
https://gohugo.io/ static site generator.

Get the theme here: https://github.com/solutionroute/hugo-smorg.

## Features

Hugo-smorg is buzzword compliant and more:

* Easy to understand.
* Mobile first, thanks [Bulma][]!
* Easy to apply a new colour "swatch" with [Bulmaswatch][].
* Minimalistic in nature, easily made more, or less, complicated.
* Produces Atom syndication format with option to disable RSS; [details
here](https://github.com/comfusion/after-dark/issues/32#issuecomment-312515542).
* An ongoing work in progress, I'm using it as a base for other projects and am
  motivated to keep this theme up to date with Hugo features as it evolves.
