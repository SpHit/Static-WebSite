<!-- filter-html.html
	Intended to be used for filtering content to be included in RSS and Atom feeds.

	It'd be nice if Hugo grew attributes (a slice of attributes) that safeHTML would drop.

	Filter HTML content to remove:
	- script tags
	- extra \n<p></p> at end of summary, produced by Summary
	- style attributes
-->
{{- $noscript := replaceRE `<script.*?>(.|\n)*?</script>` "" . }} 
{{- $noscript := replaceRE `(<.*?) (style=".*?")` "$1 " $noscript }}
{{- $noscript := replaceRE `\n<p></p>$` "" $noscript }}
{{ $noscript | safeHTML }}
