## Quick start

### Get the theme

From the root of your Hugo site:
```sh
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/hivickylai/hugo-theme-introduction.git introduction
```

### Configure your site

From the exampleSite, copy `config.toml` to the root folder of your Hugo site and change the fields as you like.

Start with:

1. Set your baseurl to your site's domain
1. Set your blog's title and your first name
1. Set your introduction header height (use "medium", "large", or "fullheight")
1. Choose "light" or "dark" theme
1. Set your avatar image
1. Set your timezone, if you choose to show it
1. Choose whether or not to show the Blog and Projects sections, and configure them to your liking
1. Input your social site urls and font-awesome icon names - use as many as you like

### Create About and Contact pages

Run:
```sh
$ hugo new about.md 
$ hugo new contact.md
```
Then edit the markdown files with the content you'd like shown in your main page's About and Contact sections.

## Preview your site locally

Use Hugo's built-in server to see your site in action as you make changes.

```
$ hugo serve -t introduction
```

Visit `localhost:1313` in your browser to see a live preview of your site.

## Blog posts

To create a new blog post, run:
```
$ hugo new blog/your-post-title.md
```

## Projects

To create a new project entry, run:
```
$ hugo new projects/your-project-name.md
```

### Project front matter

Project parameters look like this:
```
---
title: "Design"
date: 2017-11-13T12:21:16-05:00
image: "img/plant.jpg"
external_link: ""
weight: 2
---
```

Projects are ordered on the main page by `weight` first, then by `date`.

The `image` will show up on the main page and in the project's details view. If you don't specify an image, the `placeholderimg` from your site's `config.toml` file will be used.

If you don't specify a `title`, only the photo will show. You can still add content to the file to "caption" the image, and this will show in the popup. (Great way to create a simple gallery!)

If you leave `external_link` empty, clicking on a project on your main page will pop up a window with the project's details. If you specify a url instead, clicking on the project on your main page will take you to that url.
