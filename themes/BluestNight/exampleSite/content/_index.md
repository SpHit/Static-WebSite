BluestNight is a powerful and featureful theme made for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), the static site builder. Written from scratch, it was made with these goals in mind:

- Look clean, organized, and professional
- Provide users with customizations to make the site fit their needs
- Optimize the generated website to load quickly and, as much as possible, help* it achieve a score of ["Good"](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbluestnight.shadow53.com) on Google's [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).

<small>
* As a theme, BluestNight can only do so much to help improve a page's loading speed. It is on the site author to optimize their server configurations and any images used in the site to further improve loading times.
