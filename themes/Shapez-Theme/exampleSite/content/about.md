The shapez theme is a theme created with [hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
Hugo is a static site generator using markdown-files to render it's content.

__Special thanks__ goes to Freepik, Daniel Bruce and Plainicon for publishing their icons at [Flaticon](http://www.flaticon.com).
Furthermore I would like to thank the creator of the [Slender Theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/slender/), wich brought me to create my own theme - using some code of slender ;)
