"Ha! Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?"
<br><br>
"It is a gun. But I am also happy to see you."
<br><br>
<!--more-->
"...I knew it was a gun, Rich. I was making a joke, you know? Because your gun was sticking out like- oh, nevermind. You friggin' aliens will never get the joke."
<br><br>
"You could try the line again? I will laugh this time."
<br><br>
"No. It's ruined now."
<br><br>
"Is that why you are upset, then?"
<br><br>
"I'm not upset. It just would've been a good joke."
<br><br>
"You are upset. Your symptoms show it."
<br><br>
"Gah- I told you to stop doing that! You don't need to know my body temperature or metabolism at the moment or whatever the heck you were looking for. Stop using your weird power things."
<br><br>
"They are not weird."
<br><br>
"Maybe not on Mars."
<br><br>
"I didn't come from Mars."
<br><br>
"You know what I mean!"
<br><br>
"Sometimes I am not sure, little earthling."
<br><br>
"Seriously. Don't call me that."
<br><br>
"I have nothing else to call you, since you stated that you preferred me not to call you Elizabeth Sandra Lener."
<br><br>
"That's my full name. Just call me Liz. Don't you aliens have nicknames in some way?"
<br><br>
"No."
<br><br>
"Well, geez. Okay then."
<br><br>
"...I am still confused on the matter of what to call you. Is Liz acceptable?"
<br><br>
"Yes, that's fine. I don't like hearing my full name, anyways. Reminds me of my parents."
<br><br>
"I was not aware that such a thing would be bad."
<br><br>
"It's not, for most people. Just... I didn't really like my parents, so, yeah..."
<br><br>
"I... I am- I do not know what to say at this point."
<br><br>
"That's alright, Rich. You don't have to say anything."
<br><br>
"But, I...What do earthlings say to one another to cheer them up?"
<br><br>
"It depends. Sometimes it's 'everything will be okay', or 'cheer up', or sometimes they don't say anything at all. Sometimes actions are better than words."
<br><br>
"What sort of actions?"
<br><br>
"Oh, I dunno; hugs, a clap on the back."
<br><br>
"What is a... hug?"
<br><br>
"....You don't know what a hug is? That's pretty standard knowledge down here, Rich. I thought you said you knew everything about us there was to know."
<br><br>
"Everything I know is from books, or paper. Emotion was not... included, or translated correctly."
<br><br>
"Huh? What do you mean, 'not translated correctly'?"
<br><br>
"There were mentions of different emotions that I read, but, ah... I believe that the authors were confused. They did not 'translate', or, what is the word.... they did not explain them correctly. I know that being rude or insulting will result in a human taking offense. I know that a compliment will produce a smile, or heightening of happiness. But I still cannot predict or describe a great many emotions that you have shown me. It is frustrating."
<br><br>
"If it makes you feel any better, a lot of humans get frustrated with that, too. It's not easy for any of us."
<br><br>
"Thank you. It does make me feel better."
<br><br>
"...C'mere for a second."
<br><br>
"Ah! Liz... wha- what is this?"
<br><br>
"This is a hug. Now you put your arms around me."
<br><br>
"Like...like this?"
<br><br>
"Yep. You're a natural, Rich."
<br><br>
"...I like them."
<br><br>
"Everyone likes hugs."
<br><br>
"What happens now?"
<br><br>
"Now... we let go."
<br><br>
"...Alright."
